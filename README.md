First at all, begin configuring our testing environment.

## Run test cases
Before running, check the testing units work correctly and each case runs without any error & exceptions:

## Upload library|api

In the path of the android project, add the JFrog Artefactory plug, adding the following statement:

```gradle
classpath "org.jfrog.buildinfo:build-info-extractor-gradle:3.1.1"
```

Next, add the plugins for your library module into gradle file, `artifactory-plug` is to make and update the packaging artifact, and `maven-plug`  to publish into a maven-central repository:

```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
apply plugin: 'com.jfrog.artifactory'
apply plugin: 'maven-publish'
```

Defining variables: name and number of the library

```gradle
def packageName = 'fudi.freddy.api'
def libraryVersion = '1.0.a'
```

Overwrite the `publish gradle task`, which you set the GrooupId, version, and path of the library

```gradle
publishing {
    publications {
        aar(MavenPublication) {
            groupId packageName
            version = libraryVersion
            artifactId project.getName()
            // Packaging the *.aar, be careful with flavours  
            ("$buildDir/outputs/aar/${project.getName()}-release.aar")
        }
    }
}
```

Create a task for packaging, you could configure it for your flavor levels
```gradle
artifactory {
    contextUrl = 'http://localhost:8081/artifactory'
    publish {
        repository {
            // Access keys to repo 
            repoKey = 'libs-release-local'
            username = "admin"
            password = "123qweASD"
        }
        defaults {
            // which artifacts should be published
            publications('aar')
            publishArtifacts = true

            properties = ['qa.level': 'basic', 'dev.team': 'core']
            // Publish generated POM files
            publishPom = true
        }
    }
}
```

In terminal, start running JFrog-Artefactory
* Windows: run statement *"artefactoryService.exe"*
* MAC / Ubuntu: mediante el batch "artefactory.sh" 

Once finish configuring, the server runs by dfault in port 8081 (you could change in tomcat/conf/server.xml)

![center](snapshot/i.png#center)

![center](snapshot/a.png#center)

Will set up the password server 

![center](snapshot/e.png#center)

We choose the architecture that we need to deploy (`maven` in this case)

![center](snapshot/f.png#center)

![center](snapshot/g.png#center)

Displaying a dashboard, we could start working the apis repository

![center](snapshot/h.png#center)

Now send the artefact to the apis repository using the following commands

```sh
# build the packaging
./gradlew clean build
# Having built correctky, the artefact, which has pom file and documentation, is going to be deployed in the server
./gradlew assembleRelease generatePomFileForAarPublication artifactoryPublish 
```

In the menu, we can see the publishing library

![center](snapshot/k.png#center)

![center](snapshot/l.png#center)

Here, the dashboard shows the group ID: fudi.freddy.api, Artifact ID: api and version: 1.0.a.

## Download library/api

In this way, you can use this open-source plataform in any organization

Like any maven library, you have to put where the maven repository was in order to find your library dependecies (pom configuration).

Add the full `maven-repository` url, which can be found into the dashboqard, into gradle files:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local" }
}
```

Add gradle dependency
```sh
//implementation project(':api')
implementation 'fudi.freddy.api:api:1.0.a'
```
